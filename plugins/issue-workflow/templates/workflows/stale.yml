            This issue has been inactive for 30 days.
            It will be closed in 14 days unless there's new activity.

            **Quick triage:**
            - Still relevant? → Comment with next steps
            - Blocked? → Add `blocked` label
            - No longer needed? → Close it now

          close-issue-message: |
            Closed due to 44 days of inactivity.

            If this is still relevant, reopen it — closed issues are searchable.
